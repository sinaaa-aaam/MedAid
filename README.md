## Features
### 1. **User Authentication**
   - Secure user registration and login system.
   - Passwords are hashed for safety using PHP's `password_hash()` function.
   - Session-based authentication for user authorization.  

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - Users can manually input health metrics such as:
     - **Steps** (daily step count)
     - **Sleep** (hours of sleep)
     - **Heart Rate** (beats per minute)
     - **Calories** (calories consumed or burned)
   - All data is stored with timestamps for historical analysis.

### 3. **Personalized Insights**
   - Tailored health advice provided based on user data patterns.
   - Advice is dynamically selected from a predefined dataset to mimic AI behavior.

### 4. **Health Risk Predictions**
   - Basic predictions for potential health risks (e.g., "Hypertension" or "Diabetes") with categorized risk levels such as "Low", "Medium", or "High".
   - Predictions are generated using a lightweight ML model.

### 5. **Reminders and Recommendations**
   - Users can schedule reminders for activities such as:
     - Hydration
     - Exercise
     - Sleep
   - Personalized recommendations to improve health habits.
